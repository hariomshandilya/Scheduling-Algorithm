# Scheduling-Algorithm
In this I will use all the cpu scheduling algorithms.

# About this project-
Currently prevalent round robin CPU scheduling algorithms are not applicable
in real time operating systems because of their large waiting time, large
turnaround time, large response time, high context switch rates and less
throughput. The primary aim of this paper is to come up with a method for
round robin CPU scheduling which enhances the CPU performance in a real
time operating system. The proposed algorithm for real time systems is a hybrid
of priority and round-robin scheduling algorithms. It combines the merits of
round robin, like elimination of starvation, and priority scheduling. The
proposed algorithm also deals with aging by assigning variable priorities to the
processes. Thus the algorithm corrects all the limitations of RR CPU scheduling
algorithm. We will also present a comparative analysis of our new algorithm
with the existing algorithms like priority and round robin on the basis of
average turnaround time, average waiting time, varying time quantum and
number of context switches.
